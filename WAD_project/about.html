        <h2>What is Organic Farming?</h2>
        <p>Organic farming is a sustainable agricultural method that emphasizes the use of natural processes and materials. This approach focuses on maintaining healthy ecosystems, enhancing soil fertility, and promoting biodiversity. Unlike conventional farming, which often relies on synthetic chemicals, organic farming encourages the use of organic fertilizers, crop rotations, and biological pest control to create a balanced agricultural system.</p>
        <p>The roots of organic farming can be traced back to the early 20th century when pioneers recognized the negative impact of chemical agriculture. Today, organic farming has become a global movement, aiming to provide healthier food options while preserving the environment.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Understand Your Soil</h3>
                <p>Before starting your organic farm, it’s crucial to understand your soil. Conduct soil tests to determine its pH level, nutrient content, and organic matter. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions about amendments and crop selection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Crops</h3>
                <p>Choose crops that are well-suited to your local climate and soil conditions. Research which plants thrive in your region and consider companion planting to maximize space and natural pest control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3: Use Organic Seeds</h3>

                <h3>Step 4: Prepare Your Land</h3>
                <p>Clear the land of debris and weeds. Add organic matter such as compost to improve soil structure and fertility. This preparation is critical for a successful growing season.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5: Implement Natural Pest Control</h3>
                <p>Natural pest control methods, such as beneficial insects, companion planting, and organic sprays, help maintain a healthy ecosystem while minimizing pest damage.</p>
